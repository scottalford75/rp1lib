# rp1lib

User space memory mapped peripheral library for the Raspberry Pi RP1 chip.

This library utilises
	gpiochip_rp1 library for GPIO control
	spi-dw library, based on spi-dw-core kernel library, for SPI

This library can hopefully form the base for a fully functional RP1 library to include the other hardware features of the RP1 chip. I2C, PWM etc
